            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I studied fine art and printmaking and apprenticed in restoration. While freelancing for various antique dealers I was hired to work in Quebec canada to create new products for recycled metal garden and home accent company. I had no experinece in metal fabrication, much less speaking french, but i was able to work with enginneers and artists to create products fro american and european markets. I eventually become creative director as the compnay grew and found myself responible for all things visiual including publishing all marketing materials,photography, graphic design for both pring and web. My expertise was mostly in hands on development and training craftsmen and artisans around the world. I published two catalogs a year plus advertising in various publications with a team of talnted artists who really thought outside the box. My experince with codiing was limited to just prototyping websites as my time was very limited. I wanted to develop better skills to meet the demnads and workload that was required of my and my team. Mostly self taught, ive dabbled in most forms of digital art and I enjoy experimenting with videa and images using techniques for corrupting data to create unusual effeects. I'm studying software development to further create and have more freedom to experiment and create.
