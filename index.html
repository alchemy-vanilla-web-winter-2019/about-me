        <p>
            Bonnie was born in Anchorage, Alaska. When she was 18 she moved to Los Angeles where she went to the University of Southern California and earned a degree
            in Biomedical Engineering. She moved to Portland in 2010 and never looked back.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bonnie is the mother of two childre, <strong>Leland</strong> who is 8 and <strong>Magnolia</strong> who is 5. She recently became the owner of a three month
            old black cat who she named Barack, or Barry for short. Bonnie is obsessed with him and he's pretty obsessed with her too.
        </p>

            Bonnie spent many years at home raising her babies, which were some of the best years of her life. However, she missed the intellectual stimulation and 
            independence afforded by a regular job and started looking into careers in software development. Combined with her engineering background, her natural 
            inclination toward STEM-related topics, her love of coming up with solutions to problems, and a love of language which translates to coding languages as
            well, her initial foray into programming has been exciting and rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to software development, Bonnie has a strong interest in homebirth midwifery. While that career is not a viable option at this time- homebirth
            midwives are on call 24/7 and could be gone at a birth for days on end- she can envision a future when her children are grown where she does freelance software
            development work and attends births on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            In her free time, when she has it, which she won't while she's attending classes at Alchemy, Bonnie enjoys going for long trail runs. She's spend hundreds of miles
            and dozens of hours meditating to the repetitive pounding of her feet on the trails in Forest Park, the Gorge, and the innumerable other insanely beautiful places
            in the Pacific Northwest.
